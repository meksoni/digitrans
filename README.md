## ðŸš€&nbsp; About this Project

For a conference held in 2022, I developed a website using Sulu CMS, Twig, Webpack, and Bootstrap 5. This site serves as the central hub for all conference-related information, allowing users easy access to key details and interaction through various forms.

Key Features of the Website:

- Speakers and Agenda: The site includes detailed information about the speakers and the conference agenda, with descriptions of the topics presented.
- Sponsors: Sponsors are categorized into three levels: platinum, gold, and silver. Each sponsor has its own page with information about the company, including a description of their activities, a link to their website, and a mini portfolio.
- Registration Forms: I implemented forms for conference registration, sponsorship applications, and membership applications for the union. All forms are tailored to provide users with a simple and quick registration process.
- Admin Dashboard: I created an admin dashboard that allows for easy management of the website content, including adding new speakers, updating the agenda, and managing sponsors.
- Blocks for New Sections and Pages: The frontend was developed using Twig templates, enabling flexibility in creating and updating new sections and pages of the site through the admin panel.
- The site is optimized for all devices using Bootstrap 5, ensuring a responsive design and excellent user experience. The use of Webpack further enables efficient resource management and site performance.

This project successfully met all requirements and contributed to the successful execution of the conference, providing organizers and participants with the necessary tools for easy management and access to information.
